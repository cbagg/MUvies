1622763446414323   This chamber looks like a resting place of the noble class.  It appears
1622763446414324 as though it has faced severe abuse.  Caskets are thrashed and torn apart,
1622763446414325 leaving bones and sinew all over.  The stench of fresh meat is prevalent
1622763446414326 through these halls as you push onward.  The creak and rustling of

1622763448903987 A large crypt fiend stands here, wielding a whip of fire.  His skin looks
1622763448903988 burnt, bloody red as if his skin has been torn off.  He looks hateful and
1622763448903989 angry as he paces back and forth.  It seems much of his journey is
1622763448903990 suffering.  Two gnarled horns grow out of the side of his head, pointing
1622763448903991 backwards.  He has a look of pain dwelling deep in his eyes.
